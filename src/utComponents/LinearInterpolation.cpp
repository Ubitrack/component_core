 *
 * The calculation is done by calling the linearInterpolate

 *
 * @par Input Ports
 * PushConsumer<EventType> port with name "AB".
 *
 * @par Output Ports
 * PullSupplier<EventType> port with name "AB-Interpolated".
 *
 * @par Configuration
 * The "maxAge" (ms) dataflow attribute limits the amount of
 * extrapolation.
 *
 * @par Operation
 * Whenever an event is requested via the pull output port
 * the component either interpolates or extrapolates
 * from the last two events received via the input port
 * using linear interpolation.
 *
 * If the time difference is larger than some configured value
 * or of less than two events have been received so far,
 * the component cannot deliver.
 *
 * @par Instances
 * Registered for the following EventTypes and names:
 * - Ubitrack::Measurement::Pose : PoseLinearInterpolation
